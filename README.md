I'm a passionate developer who enjoys building things. Coding has always been an interest of mine, and last year I decided to fully commit to that passion. I began with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and today I’m mainly focused on building [GuessTheGrade](https://github.com/luukdg/guess-the-grade-react), a platform where climbers can watch bouldering videos and guess the grade.

## 🎥 From Filmmaking to Front-End
Before moving into front-end development, I worked as a filmmaker and motion designer at a marketing agency. That creative background sharpened my eye for storytelling, design, and polished user experiences, something I now bring into each project I build.

## 💼 Open to Opportunities
I'm currently open to new opportunities, so feel free to reach out.
